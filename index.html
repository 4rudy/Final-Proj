                <h2>Ace's First Championship</h2>
                <p>For the first time ever, the Las Vegas Aces are WNBA champions. On Sunday afternoon, the Aces hung on for a dramatic 78-71 win over the Connecticut Sun in Game 4 of the 2022 Finals to take the series 3-1. In addition to this being the franchise's first title, it is also the first major professional title for a team in Las Vegas.
                    The first half was a rugged, forgettable affair in which each team had a scoreless streak that lasted over five minutes. Thankfully, both teams settled down and found a rhythm in the second half to create a much more enjoyable experience. The game going down to the wire helped in that department as well.
                    Late in the fourth quarter, the Aces opened up a six-point lead and appeared to be on the verge of pulling away. Instead, the Sun converted a five-point possession after Kelsey Plum's reckless closeout on DeWanna Bonner's 3-point attempt was upgraded to a flagrant foul. That swing allowed the Sun to jump right back into the game, and they briefly grabbed the lead with 2:22 remaining on a Courtney Williams jumper.
                    From that point on, though, it was all Aces and all Riquna Williams. Inserted into the game when the Aces went to their small-ball lineup, Williams scored eight straight points for the Aces on a pair of 3-pointers and step-back jumper. Kelsey Plum added a bucket, Jackie Young added a free throw and that was it.
                    Chelsea Gray led the way for the Aces with another terrific postseason performance, finishing with 20 points, five rebounds and six assists on 9 of 13 from the field. For her efforts, not only in Game 4 but throughout the series, Gray was named 2022 Finals MVP. </p>

                <h2>Season Kick Off</h2>
                <p>Opening night for the 2023 season is set for May 19 and will feature a four-game slate: Connecticut Sun vs. Indiana Fever, New York Liberty vs. Washington Mystics, Chicago Sky vs. Minnesota Lynx and Phoenix Mercury vs. Los Angeles Sparks. That night will see No. 1 overall pick Aliyah Boston make her debut for the Fever and Brittney Griner make her return with the Mercury.
                    The defending champion Las Vegas Aces will not be in action on opening night. They will play their first game on May 20, though it will be on the road against the Seattle Storm in a rematch of last season's semi-final playoff series.
                    As for the new-look New York Liberty, their first home game won't be until May 21, when they host the Fever. That will be the debut in New York for Breanna Stewart, Jonquel Jones and Courtney Vandersloot; the All-Star trio all joined during the offseason.</p>

                <h2>Horrible Trades</h2>
                <p>The fans, and by the fans I mean myself and myself only, are heavily confused as about the trades that happened in the off season. The best point garud in the league, Courtney Vandersloot, has been traded from the Chicago Sky to the New York Liberty! What could
                    Chicago possibly have been thinking? What was Vandersloot thinking? Vandersloot is in the top 3 for all time assists and the Sky let her walk away. Insane. Jonquel Jones of the Connecticut Sun has also been traded from her home and to the Liberty. They (the Liberty) have come up big for this season, as Breanna Stewart of the Seattle Storm, will be joining them as well. We'll see how the Liberty handle the trio.
                    Candance Parker of the Chicago Sky "announced" she'll be joining the Aces in the upcomming season, and there are zero complaints come from the Sky fans. It will be tough luck for Parker however, there is no room for her there. MVP A'ja Wilson has already made her mark there. Parker should have stayed with Chicago. Good luck to her, regardless. Speaking of the Aces, they have no major changes for the next season.
                    As always, looking forward to watching Wilson play. Special shout out to Dearica Hamby - 2 time, 6th woman of the year. Always deserved. Any other trades made in the off season simply are not important enough to be documented.
                    Best of luck to all teams this season!
